These are scripts to facilitate extracting NeuroML2 versions of the BBP cell models.

This is based on the export_to_neuroml2() method in PyNeuroML, with some BBP specific extras.

To execute these scripts, first run:

    nrnivmodl ../NEURON/

This compiles the NMODL files for the ion channels into this directory. Then type:

    python  ParseAll.py
